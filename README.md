## Security
* [Client-side document encryption](#encryption)
* No registration required. Encryptic manages signup/login via security tools built in to all modern browsers.
* By default, Encryptic stores notes using the database in your browser (such as indexedDB or localStorage). This means that no data is synced to the cloud without your permission.

## Quick Start (recommended)

* Open [app.encryptic.org](https://app.encryptic.org/) and get started in less than 30 seconds.
* No extra steps are required!

## Install Standalone Desktop App (beta)

**NOTE: IF YOU ARE UPGRADING FROM AN OLD VERSION OF Encryptic, BACKUP EVERYTHING FIRST.  THIS CODE HAS BEEN TESTED BUT MANY THINGS HAVE CHANGED.  DATA LOSS IS POTENTIAL.**

Install a version of Encryptic from here:

https://github.com/encryptic-team/Encryptic/releases/

### Post installation

None.  Removed the signal server component for the time being.

#### Arch Linux (or derived distributions)

* Install the package [hosted here](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/Encryptic/). Once installed, run: `$ pacaur -S Encryptic`

> *Running into issues with Arch Linux installation? Report [here](https://github.com/funilrys/PKGBUILD/issues/new) or contact [@funilrys](https://github.com/funilrys) on Gitter [here](https://gitter.im/funilrys_/PKGBUILD)*.

### Previous Releases

* All historical releases[ are available here](https://github.com/Encryptic/Encryptic/releases).

## Developer Install & Documentation

Setting up the Encryptic development environment only takes a few minutes. To run locally, you need to have the following installed:
* [Node.js version 8.11.4 or 10.9.0](https://nodejs.org/). Encryptic works with other previous Node versions, but requires changes to `package.json` and is not recommended.
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) (note: Windows users need to set the PATH variable for git after installation).
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) You can use npm but it's not recommended due to inconsistencies observed in the modules installed.


### Part One: Install Encryptic

If you're planning to contribute to the project's development, hit the fork button at the top of the page and move on to **step 2**.
<br/>

```
<br/>

**2. Navigate to project directory and checkout `dev` branch:**

```
<br/>

**3. Install Gulp:**

## Coding Style Guidelines

We ask that you use either **plain JavaScript or the [Marionette.js](http://marionette.js/) framework** (for more details on the preferred coding style see [.editorconfig](https://github.com/Encryptic/Encryptic/blob/master/.editorconfig)). All experimental changes are pushed to the `dev` branch. Feature changes need to be done on either `dev` or a branch that uses `dev` as its parent.

Localizations [are available here.](https://github.com/Encryptic/Encryptic/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTE.md)

## Encryption

**However, in our effort to permanently enhance the application's security**, Encryptic is implementing OpenPGP encryption via [OpenPGP.js](https://github.com/openpgpjs/openpgpjs).
